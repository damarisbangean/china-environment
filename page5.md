> Network mapping, or network analysis, is used in this section to compare and understand the discussion of climate change across Chinese media sources obtained for this project. Network mapping is a script that provides analysis and visualization of nodes that are correlated based on different proximity measures, and produces clusters by identifying dense groups. In 2008, Mathieu Jacomy and others [created](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0098679) network visualization software through Gephi in order to provide social scientists with network analysis tools without 'learning graph theory'. For our research, we used Cortext's [Network Mapping](https://docs.cortext.net/analysis-mapping-heterogeneous-networks/) script in order to compare and understand the discourse of 'climate change' across Chinese media sources, and how it interacts with other terms related to the environment.

> ## A. Methodology 

> The networks below map out the interaction between 150-200 of the most frequent terms within a given corpus. Initially, we extracted a term list from the corpus combining all sources, and edited it to remove unrelated terms, such as ‘km squared’ and ‘last week'. We left terms related to the research project, including ‘pearl river delta’, ‘pollution’, and ‘climate change’. For comparison purposes, we also extracted similar term lists from South China Daily Post and China Daily, and used them to analyze their respective corpora.

> In order to analyze their interaction, we used the Cortext network mapping tool to produce heterogeneous and homogeneous maps, where the nodes are clustered into groups based on their co-occurrence and proximity. In a heterogeneous map, the program uses two fields to develop ‘communities of nodes’. In this case, the first field included ‘Subject’ and the second field included ‘Terms’. The program calculated the raw co-occurrence of 150 nodes based on a direct chi2 measure with a proximity threshold of 0.1. Producing a homogeneous map involved a similar process, but it used only a single field of 'Terms' in determining clusters. While other parameters were the same, we applied a distributional measure, rather than a chi2 measure, to observe co-occurrence between the terms and analyze the clusters (categories) under which they fell without having 'Subject' as a determining field.

> ## B. Research 

> In looking at the maps, the structures of the homogeneous and heterogeneous maps seem different. For one, the heterogeneous map looks more intertwined, whereas the homogeneous map forms an arc. It is important to keep in mind that the clusters within the heterogeneous map emerge from an interaction between terms around subjects discussed within the sources generated by Cortext, whereas in the homogeneous map the clusters are formed based on a distributional co-occurrence between the terms. The results regarding their discourse of environmental issues are comparable. In the heterogeneous map, ‘climate change’ can be found under the subject titled ‘Climate Change & Global/World Issues’, and the nearest clusters include ‘Economic News & Trade’, and ‘Regulation/Government Policy & Market’. The cluster titled ‘Air/Water/Land Quality & Air Pollution’, however, is on the other end of the map. The term ‘air/water/land quality’ under 'Air/Water/Land Quality & Air Pollution' is tied to ‘emissions’ mentioned under ‘Climate Change’, but otherwise the overall link between two seem to be weak.

> The pattern in the homogeneous structure below is more rigid. On the left end of the arc, the ‘Authorities & River’ cluster discusses ‘air pollution’, ‘air quality’, ‘smog’, ‘local governments’, ‘water’, ‘environment’, ‘environmental protection’ and ‘village’. This is closely linked with the cluster titled ‘Species & Nature’, which contains ‘sea’, ‘research’, ‘marine’, ‘trees’ and ‘forest’. While these two are intertwined, they are also associated with terms including ‘government’, ‘plan’, and ‘waste’. This could suggest that articles are more likely to discuss water and pollution levels in a local context. 

> ### Homogeneous Clusters-By Terms

> <iframe src="https://documents.cortext.net/lib/mapexplorer/explorerjs.html?file=https://assets.cortext.net/docs/a5cccb6d4d494a6092d1cfd53d094e5b" frameborder="0" style="overflow:hidden;border:1px solid #DDDDDD;" width="1100" height="800" allowfullscreen></iframe>

> On the other hand, the discussion of ‘climate change’ occurs at the other right end of the arc. It appears with terms, including ‘agreement’, ‘conference’, ‘emissions’, ‘sustainable development’, and ‘developing countries’. Its closest clusters include ‘Organizations & Program’, and ‘Sector & Market’. As such, the discussion of climate change co-occurs in a broader, and possibly a more international context. Moreover, there are no links with the left side of the arc discussing local environmental issues. As such, it is possible that while ‘climate change’ may occur in a domestic environmental context across the media sources, the chances of this happening are rather low. Instead, it could be suggested that while ongoing environmental problems are seen as domestic responsibility, the media is less likely to link such issues to climate change, which is considered in a more global context. 

> ## Newspaper Comparisons-South China Morning Post vs. China Daily

> In addition to analyzing clusters across all sources, we also zoomed in on China Daily and South China Morning Post. South China Morning Post is a Hong Kong newspaper, and China Daily is a mainland, government-controlled newspaper. Similarly to the method discussed above, we extracted 150 of the most frequent terms from these sources, and, after light editing, used them to create homogeneous clusters. Our aim was to compare how these sources cover environmental issues and climate change, and to analyze differences in their discourse. 

> ### South China Morning Post

> Although the South China Morning Post network is homogeneous, it is more similar to the heterogeneous map of all news sources. It reveals intertwining clusters, particularly those mentioning ‘air pollution’ and ‘climate change’. The discourse of ‘climate change’ is still confined within the limits of discussing global issues (under 'China & Nation'), and is tied with terms including ‘Organization’, ‘state’, and ‘Asia’. ‘Air pollution’ falls under ‘Air Pollution & Pollution’ cluster, which also mentions ‘Pearl River Delta’, ‘vehicles’, and ‘health’. The discussion of water and land pollution, and waste appear in separate clusters that are spread out, although the links remain. Most importantly, despite having no direct links between the terms ‘climate change’ and ‘air pollution’, the clusters in which they are being discussed show connections, which is different from the homogeneous network demonstrated above. As such, it is possible to suggest that the likelihood that climate change and air pollution will be covered together in South China Morning Post is slightly higher than across all media sources.

> ### China Daily 
> In contrast to South China Morning Post, the China Daily map is shaped like an arc, similarly to the homogeneous network analyzing all sources. The term ‘climate change’ appears under ‘Climate Change and Nation’, which is intertwined with issues regarding market and economy. The terms identified with ‘climate change’ include ‘organizations’, ‘United States’, ‘leaders’ and the ‘UN’. Interestingly, while ‘China’ appears under the similar cluster as ‘climate change’ in the South China Morning Post, in China Daily it appears under the cluster discussing economic growth. On the left side of the map, the China Daily articles have three closely intertwined clusters regarding ‘Mountains & Park’, ‘Cars & Vehicle’, and ‘Province & Bureau’. These all contain issues linked to domestic environmental problems. For instance, ‘Mountains & Park’ contains: ‘conservation’, ‘natural reserves’, ‘birds’, and ‘nature’; ‘Province and Bureau’ contains ‘city’, ‘waste’, ‘environment’, ‘air pollution’, along with ‘bureau’ and ‘province’. ‘Cars & Vehicles’ is a small section that is linked with ‘air pollution’ and ‘air quality’.

>  However, as in the homogeneous network analyzing all sources, there are no direct links between local environmental issues and the discussion of climate change, suggesting that it is less likely for China Daily to cover these two topics together. Moreover, as overall environmental issues appear in the context of ‘bureau’ and ‘province’, it is possible to assume that local governments are seen as being responsible for tackling China’s domestic environmental problems. Climate change, on the other hand, is seen as a global issue in which local efforts are not necessarily considered.
